/*
 * The public keyword is an access modifier, which allows the programmer to
 * control the visibility of class members. When a class member is preceded by
 * public, then that member may be accessed by code outside the class in which
 * it is declared. (The opposite of public is private, which prevents a member
 * from being used by code defined outside of its class.) In this case, main( )
 * must be declared as public, since it must be called by code outside of its
 * class when the program is started. The keyword static allows main( ) to be
 * called without having to instantiate a particular instance of the class. This
 * is necessary since main( ) is called by the Java Virtual Machine before any
 * objects are made.
